### 🛠️ Core Expertise & Focus

I specialize in building **performant, systems** in C/C++ and Go. My work sits at the intersection of **systems programming, data engineering, and machine learning**—where control over memory, latency, and architecture is paramount. I'm deeply interested in taking complex concepts and implementing them efficiently from the ground up.

**Programming Paradigm:** I focus on **resource-aware, modular, and testable design**. My projects are built to be understood, extended, and integrated.
